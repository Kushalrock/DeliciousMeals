# Delicious Meals

A flutter project where you can see different meal items, save your favourites, choose from different flters and also get their recipes. It uses different screens and can be a great project for beginners to have a look and learn about flutter.

If you have VS Code or any editor installer and also fllutter and Android studio properly configured. You can open any AVD from Android Studio or connect a real device and use

```
flutter run
```
or just use run without debugging or with debugging to get this app on your emulator or your real device.

Good luck devs \n
